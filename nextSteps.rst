Next Steps
==========

* Everyone else in this class has a desire to learn to program as well and are local to your community, definitely exhange emails, phone numbers, etc.  Meet up with each other and practice together!  The local library here will give you this room to meet in, just talk to the front desk about reserving a room!

* Learn about functions and flow control.
