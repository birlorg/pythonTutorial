Something you should know.  Recently there was a new version of Python (version 3) which is what we are learning in this class.  A lot of tutorials online are still written for the old version of Python (version 2).  Most of what works in Python 2 works in Python 3, but not all.  So if something is not working, despite someone saying it will work, it could be a difference between version 2 and version 3.

Thanks for coming! Please leave feedback on how I can improve this class on the questions page (https://pad.riseup.net/p/python) or email me (python@birl.org) Alternatively you can make changes to the code for this site here: https://github.com/birlorg/pythonTutorial
