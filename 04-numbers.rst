Numbers in Python
=================

Get your computer to the Python shell (see :doc:`02-setupEnvironment` if you need help)

In Computers we have different types of Numbers, we have whole numbers (Integers), like 5, decimal numbers like $53.26 and Floating point numbers like 3.1415926.....

Integers (whole numbers):

>>> 5
>>> 10
>>> 9999

Floating point numbers (numbers with decimals):

>>> 1.0
>>> .00000567
>>> 3.14159

We can do math on numbers with "Arithmetic Operators":
	* addition: +
	* subtraction: -
	* multiplication: *
	* division: /

Try doing some math in the interactive shell:

>>> 2 + 2
>>> 10 - 5
>>> 400 * 12
>>> 10 / 3

You can Compare numbers using "comparison operators":
	* == Equal to
	* != Not equal to
	* < Less than
	* > Greater than
	* <= Less than or equal to
	* >= Greater than or equal to

>>> 5 == 5
>>> 5 >= 6
>>> 16 * 2 == 32

Decimal numbers are handled in the :mod:`python:decimal` module in python, and are not directly covered in this introduction.
